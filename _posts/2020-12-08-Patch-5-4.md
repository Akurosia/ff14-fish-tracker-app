title:  "Patch 5.4 Updates"
---

You may notice there's now a Fish Eyes button at the top right.
Activating it will apply the Fish Eyes buff and resort the list accordingly. Give it a shot!

The tracker has the new fish added in Patch 5.4, but as always, the exact conditions for catching them are still being discovered.
The tracker is manually updated to reflect the latest findings about every night.
Good luck!
