title:  "Aquamaton Currently Broken"

As of Patch 6.3, Aquamaton's intuition buff is currently broken according to numerous reports and my own testing. GMs have recently concluded their investigation into the issue and reported they have replicated the concern. While there is no timeline for when the bug will get fixed, rest assured SE is now aware.
