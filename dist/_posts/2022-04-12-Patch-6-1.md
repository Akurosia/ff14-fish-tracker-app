title:  "Patch 6.1 Updates"
---

The tracker has the new fish added in Patch 6.1, but as always, the exact conditions for catching them are still being discovered.
The tracker is manually updated to reflect the latest findings about every night.
Remember to use the Fish'cord to coordinate research into the latest fishies! Good luck!

By default, new fish are not displayed to avoid potential spoilers. If you want to see them now, just click the gear icon in the top-right and add the patch to the filter.
