title:  "Patch 5.5 Updates"
---

The tracker has the new fish added in Patch 5.5, but as always, the exact conditions for catching them are still being discovered.
The tracker is manually updated to reflect the latest findings about every night.
Remember to use the Fish'cord to coordinate research into the latest fishies! Good luck!
